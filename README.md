Instructions:

    Project Setup on GitHub: 

    Create a new repository on GitHub. Name it appropriately (e.g., cybersecurity-analysis-tool). 

    Initialize the repository with a README file that describes the project. 

    Set up the repository with the following branches: 

        main: The primary production branch. 

        development: The branch where ongoing development takes place. 

        feature/*: Branches for individual features (e.g., feature/log-analysis, feature/vulnerability-scan). 

    Version Control Tasks: 

    Clone Repository: 

        Clone the repository to your local machine. 

    Branch Management: 

        Create a new branch for a feature you will work on (e.g., feature/firewall-configuration). 

    Commit Changes: 

        Implement a small feature or make a minor change (e.g., update the README file, add a script for log analysis). 

        Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. 

    Push Changes: 

        Push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. 

    Pull Requests: 

        Create a pull request to merge your feature branch into the development branch. 

        Include a clear description of the changes and any relevant information. 

    Issue Tracking with Freshworks: 

    Set Up Freshworks: 

        Create a Freshworks account and set up a project for your GitHub repository. 

    Create Issues: 

        Log into Freshworks and create a new issue related to a feature or bug (e.g., "Implement firewall rule validation"). 

        Provide a detailed description, including steps to reproduce the bug or the requirements for the new feature. 

    Assign Issues: 

        Assign the issue to yourself or a team member. 

    Track Progress: 

        Use the Freshworks interface to update the status of the issue as you work on it (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved). 

    Link GitHub Commits to Issues: 

        In your GitHub commits, reference the Freshworks issue number (e.g., Fixes #123). 

    Cybersecurity-Specific Tasks: 

    Log Analysis Script: 

        Develop a script that analyzes log files for potential security incidents. 

        Use GitHub for version control to manage changes and improvements to the script. 

        Track any issues or bugs encountered during development in Freshworks. 

    Vulnerability Assessment: 

        Create a feature branch for a vulnerability assessment tool. 

        Document any vulnerabilities found and create corresponding issues in Freshworks. 

        Resolve these issues and track progress using GitHub and Freshworks. 

    Collaboration and Documentation: 

    Collaborate: 

        Work with your team members to ensure that everyone is following the branching and commit message conventions. 

        Review each other's code and provide constructive feedback through pull requests. 

    Documentation: 

        Update the README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project. 

        Document the process of using Freshworks for issue tracking in the repository's wiki or a separate markdown file. 

        Include any cybersecurity-specific procedures or guidelines followed during the project. 

 Submission Details: 

    Submit a report that includes: 
    The URL to your GitHub repository. 
    Screenshots of your Freshworks issues and their statuses. 
    A brief reflection on what you learned from using version control and issue tracking tools in a cybersecurity context. 

Grading Criteria: You will be graded according to the attached rubric.
